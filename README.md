Omnomhub
=========
Omnomhub is thought to be a recipesite for people who like to alter recipes, if ever so slightly. Like github, but for recipes. There are a lot of copies of recipes where people slightly alter them to match their dietary needs or tastebuds, at omnomhub you will always be able to see the original recipe, and if you want - Make your own version of it. Just like in github you can also collaborate on recipes, discuss and suggest changes to make them better.


How to install
=========

You will need the following:
* Vagrant (As of writing version 1.4.2 works) - http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
